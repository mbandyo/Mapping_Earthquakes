# Mapping Earthquakes
This project covers designing interactive maps for multiple datasets and delivering a single user friendly map with combined datasets.
The map consists of several planetary surface related information including both geological and man-made structures and facilities.
## User Guide
The map can be displayed in single or multiple available layering options. Following is a snapshot of the map:
![Earthquakes with tectonic plates](https://github.com/mbandyo/Mapping_Earthquakes/blob/main/Resources/Earthquake_Challenge.png)

The map shows streetmap and has overlays for tectonic plates, all recorded earthquakes in past week and major earthquakes of magnitude higher than 4.5.
The bottom right legend describes the magnitude of the earthquakes. Also the top right provides the options for base map including 
* Street view
* Satellite View 
* Dark base tile </br>

The overlays consists of the following layers:
* All recorded earthquakes in the past week
* Tectonic plates division
* Major earthquakes (magnitude > 4.5) in the past week

## Future Work
Other tiles and overlays could be added for richer view.
